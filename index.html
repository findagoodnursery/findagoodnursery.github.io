            <h3>About this page</h3>
            <p>There are some great resources for finding local schools, like <a href="http://www.locrating.com/">locrating.com</a>, and childminders, like <a href="https://www.childcare.co.uk/">childcare.co.uk</a>, but we struggled to find an easy way of figuring out where nurseries were located. This seemed a pity, because parents looking for a nursery may be less reliant on catchment areas and more likely to consider a location near to the office or on the way to work. Also, parents looking to move home might find it hard to tell whether it is likely to be easier or harder to find childcare in their prospective new neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>This map is an attempt to improve the situation. It shows every organisation categorised as a nursery or as "childcare on non-domestic premises" on Ofsted's website, and some information compiled by Ofsted about each setting, including the age range of children attending and data on opening times. Although I will do my best to ensure the data is as accurate and up-to-date as possible, it is advisable to double-check any information found here.</p>
            <p>If you do notice any errors or omissions, please contact me on findagoodnursery at gmail dot com.</p>
            <h3>Why might there be errors?</h3>
            <p>Much of the information displayed on this page is published by Ofsted as pdf files, which are notoriously difficult to extract information from. To make this map, computer code has had to trawl through more than 21,000 pdfs. If one document is formatted differently from the others, key information like age range may be missed, or captured incorrectly. It is hard to manually identify all of these anomalies, so please do get in touch if you find any problems.</p>
            <p>Also, a small number of nurseries are listed on the Ofsted website with postcodes that may have been changed since the day of the inspection. Out-of-date postcodes are more difficult to locate on a map, so these are not displayed above. If you know of an example of this, please drop me a line with the corrected postcode.</p>
            <h3>Why might "no recent report" have been found?</h3>
            <p>This may be a new nursery that hasn't been inspected yet. Or it could be a well-established one that hasn't been inspected for more than about five years; Ofsted reports older than this were formatted differently, and their contents are not captured for the reasons described above.</p>
